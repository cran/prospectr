# prospectr: Processing and sample selection for vis-NIR spectral data

`prospectr` provides various utilities for pre--processing and sample selection of visible and near infrared spectral data with [R](http://cran.r-project.org/). While similar functions are available in other packages, like [`signal`](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/signal/index.html), the functions in this package works indifferently for `data.frame`, `matrix` and `vector` inputs. Besides, several functions are optimized for speed and use C++ code through the [`Rcpp`](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/index.html) and [`RcppArmadillo`](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RcppArmadillo/index.html) packages.

A vignette gives an overview of the main functionalities of the package. Just type `vignette("prospectr-intro")` in the console to access it. Currently, the following preprocessing functions are available:

| Function                | Description                                                            |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `continuumRemoval`      | continuum-removed absorbance or reflectance values                     |

| `binning`               | average in column--wise subsets                                        |
| `resample`              | resample a signal to new coordinates by linear or spline interpolation |
| `resample2`             | resample a signal to new coordinates using FWHM values                 |
| `blockScale`            | block scaling                                                          | 
| `blockNorm`             | sum of squares block weighting                                         |

The selection of samples/observations for calibration of vis-NIR data can be achieved with one of the following functions

| Function    |   Description                                   |

| `cochranTest`      | detects replicate outliers with the Cochran _C_ test                         |
